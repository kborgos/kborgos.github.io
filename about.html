                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p>My name is Katya Borgos-Rodriguez and I am an undergraduate student from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez majoring in Computer Engineering and specializing in Computing Systems (Software). I am expecting to graduate in May of 2017 and plan to pursue a Ph.D in Human-Computer Interaction immediately after. When I am not studying or programming, I will most likely be drawing or playing video games. Drawing has been one of my passions ever since I was little, which is why I feel very fortunate to have been chosen to work in the Sketch Recognition Lab in Texas A&M University!
