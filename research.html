                                    Assisted in the deployment of an experiment that sought to understand how a robot moderator affects group interaction during a three-player collaborative game. Using Python, JavaScript and the Robot Operating System, I developed a traditional Checkers game to be played by older adults with family members, or against a robot companion. This game is a direct contribution to an ongoing project, which integrates a socially assistive robot as a team member to enable health-supporting behaviors for older adults, and encourage positive social interactions with their family members.

                                    As children become active citizens online, they become susceptible to new forms of bullying in online spaces. While there are ways to report cyberbullying, there are no effective ways to prevent it. In our project, we created new features for an existing social network for young girls to examine the participants&#39; activity. I developed a WordPress plugin that asked users to complete details of a story via sketching. In some activities, their friends&#39; response and identity was provided. Activities in which the participants had access to their friends&#39; responses and identities resulted in sketches with properties similar to those in their friends&#39; images. These findings suggest that conformity factors may be influenced by social relationships. We hope that this work raises awareness of children’s patterns of online conformity and contributes to the development of algorithms to identify cyberbullying activity and make the Internet safer for children.

                                    The team's goal was to develop a solution to a well-known problem in Puerto Rico of patients having to wait for prolonged periods of time when attending medical appointments. Our proposed system would provide patients with timely estimates of the time to service, through a smart phone application, on the day of the appointment. With this information, patients may opt to travel from their location to the physicians’ offices closer to the time they should be serviced instead of waiting for hours in the office. I developed an Android application where users could schedule appointments, as well as receive reminders and notifications on the time to service on the day of the appointment.
