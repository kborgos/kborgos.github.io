                    <ul>
                        <li> I was born and raised in the small, but beautiful island of Puerto Rico (<i>Snow?</i> What is that?). I moved out in 2017 to pursue my graduate education in the Northern side of the United States.</li>
                        <li> As a child, one of the first phrases I learned was "please pass me the controller". Unfortunately, I don't have as many opportunities to play video games these days, but I still like to keep up with the community and game once in a while.</li>
                        <li> Additionally, one of my lifelong passions has been art. I enjoy drawing during my spare time because it allows me to get creative and relieve stress. I hope to share some of my creations here in the future!</li>
                        <li> Finally, I enjoy to explore new places and go on adventures with my loved ones. I'm hoping I can make Asia my next destination in the near future!</li>
